Each of the 10,000 digital artworks in the collection grants holders access to unique experiences to connect with artists and own and champion their art. As a community, Moonbirds is a home for creatives, dreamers, and collectors seeking real connection as we all contribute to the future of web3 art, culture, and technology.\n\nMoonbird art is entirely in-chain, meaning the images are outputted directly from the smart contract, with no need for storage on IPFS or the like. There are also a number of customisable backgrounds available to holders based on their on-chain activity (such as other NFT holdings)—which disappear when the bird is transferred. You can check what each bird looks like with the different backgrounds (and see if they have any unclaimed rewards!) on our [site](https://proof.xyz/moonbirds)","determiner":null,"locale":"en_US","locale_alternate":null,"site_name":"OpenSea","domain":"opensea.io"}
