FIrst! ðŸ˜‡ I managed to grab one of these for free when Google Stadia was ramping up! In true Google fashion, they discontinued Stadia shortly thereafter (RIP) but still offer a service for converting to a normal wireless Bluetooth controller. The process takes about 5 minutes! YMMV!

Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³
