GM followers! ðŸŒ„

I took a break from Web 3 to get started on some project ideas that have been pushed back for too long...

Here's a preview of what I've been working on!

Everything I've done up to this point is open-sourced and available online. Please reach out if you're interested in collaborating or bouncing ideas around!

Game development is an exciting industry, and will always be on the bleeding edge of pushing tech (software and hardware) to its limits.

Excited to see what the future holds for gaming, XR, and games on web! ðŸ‘¾
